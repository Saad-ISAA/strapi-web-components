# Website Components

A lot of people are curious about the components we use on our website: [strapi.io](https://strapi.io). It is now possible! Feel free to browse all of our Strapi components.

**Important**: We are currently working on opening-sourcing our [strapi.io](https://strapi.io) website which is made with Strapi & Next.js. However, we wanted to share our components before. Note that they will not be updated as our Strapi project evolves before open-sourcing it. During this time, the folder will remain static but it already allows you to have a good idea of how we manage the components of our website.

Please understand that we will therefore not accept changes. This `website-components` folder is for the sole purpose of being consulted.

It will then be possible to contribute to our website when it will be open-source.

## How to add a component to my Strapi project

Simply move the `.json` component file in your `components/<category>` folder.
You can also import an entire category of components in your Strapi project by moving the category folder in your components folder. 

`./links` => `components/links`
